# Your Project's Name

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
Project Name: Personal Website
This project is about making a personal website about myself, so that future employers can get a better understanding of me and my skillsets. 

## Design Process

This website is for future employers and companies which would either want me to join them or for them to outsource me for skill-specific projects.
-As a future employee, I want to display my skills to my future employers, so that they may know what to expect from me working for them.
-And as a potential partner, I want to know what this person(me) specialises in, so that I know exactly what job to give this person(me) when the project is being put into action.
I make this easier for them by making the website clear and concise. They can easily navigate to my resume where they will know my educational experience, and my portfolio where they will get to see previews of my works and projects I have done. From these they will know what to expect from me if I work for them. The colour scheme is aesthetically-pleasing and comfortable on the eyes, while have proper highlights and contrasts to furthur improve the clarity of the website.
The portfolio gives accurate description of mediums I use in my works and projects, as well as descriptions if necessary.

## Features

The About Me page is simply a self-introduction of me and my intentions in life, aka to expand my horizons in art and others.
The Resume page shows the schools I am affiliated to, as well as my certificates and achievements.
The Portfolio page shows all the (better) works and projects I have done.
The Contact Me page is the area where people can send me a message, be it just a simple comment or a invitation to work with a company/group.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. About Me page:
    1. Go to any page other than the "About Me" page
    2. Press the "About Me" button
    3. Observe if the "About Me" page loads
2. Portfolio page:
    1. Go to any page other than the "Portfolio" page
    2. Press the "Portfolio" button
    3. Observe if the "Portfolio" page loads
3. Resume page:
    1. Go to any page other than the "Resume" page
    2. Press the "Resume" button
    3. Observe if the "Resume" page loads
4. Contact Me page:
    1. Go to any page other than the "Contact Me" page
    2. Press the "Contact Me" button
    3. Observe if the "Contact Me" page loads
5. Works and Projects:
    1. Hover over the images below the "Works" and "Projects" headers
    2. Observe if the image fades to show the image descriptions

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
